Subject Line:Hey Boss, How Much of an Idiot Are You?

Dear Boss,

It's no secret that you've done some crazy things in the past, but nothing can beat the stupidity of your latest antics! I mean, how much of 
an idiot are you to think that was a good idea?

It's not often that I chuckle to myself while thinking about our boss, but in this case I can't help it.

I guess you could say you're the master of all things bizarre and ridiculous. Don't worry, we all make mistakes and I'm sure you'll be back to your old self in no time.

Have a good one,

[Your name]
