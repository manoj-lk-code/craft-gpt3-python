Subject: You Giving Me The Last Laugh

Dear Boss,

Ha! I can't help but laugh at all the idiotic things you do. It's like you take pride in your ability to make a fool of yourself. Who needs an actual comedian when you're around? 

I'm sure all the other employees get a kick out of your grand schemes and plans that invariably fall flat. It must be why they're always giggling behind your back. ling behind your back.

Your antics are a wonder to behold, though at times they might not be the most productive use of everyone's time. We can only be thankful that some of your ideas occt some of your ideas occur to you and not the rest of us.

Thanks for making us all laugh and for keeping us entertained (even though you likely don't realise that's the effect you have). You're the gracelessly clownish kingracelessly clownish king of the office!

Yours in humored admiration,
[Employee Name]
