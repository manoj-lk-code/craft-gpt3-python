Subject: Noticing Your Amazing "Stupidness"

Dear Boss, 

I can't help but admire the genius level of "stupidness" you've achieved over the years. It's almost as if you were born with it, or you've developed an ability to create your own unique kind of stupidity.

It's certainly something that deserves to be recognized, and I wanted to make sure you knew how impressed I am.

Your brilliance in making foolish decisions, coming up with idiotic ideas, and creating confusing systems is unmatched. I'm in absolute awe of your commitment to ridiculousness.

Keep it up! :)

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
